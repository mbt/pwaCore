# pwaCore: A Lightweight Core PWA *Engine*

`pwaCore` is a _lightweight_ [PWA](web+jargonDict:PWA)
[engine](web+jargonDict:Engine) that aims to support all
_sufficiently modern_ browsers equally well.

## Open Questions

 - What options are there for “cloud sync” in a client-side
   PWA? Is it possible to use something like Google Drive,
   DropBox, or MEGA as synchronization backend?

 - What about the creation of a **public utility anycast node**
   which provides a rendezvous point server for peer-to-peer
   PWA applications?

 - WireGuard® VPN connections, from a PWA?

## Using a Free Development Environment?

First: **thank you, GitHub!** You’re a lifesaver in a period of time where
all hope of modern resources was gone away…
